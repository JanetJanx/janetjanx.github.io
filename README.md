# About Me
I'm pursuing a Masters of Science in Engineering and Technology Entrepreneurship at the University of Notre Dame to transition into a Creative and Innovative Business Software Engineer. 

# Research Interests
My enduring and overarching research interest centers on the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science and Cloud Computing, with a specific focus on the transformative application of the Transformer neural network architectures to investigate methods for fine-tuning pre-trained generative transformer models. At the intersection of AI and deep learning, my focus centers on exploring innovative methods to customize these models, leveraging the prowess of the Transformer architecture and natural language processing (NLP) to significantly enhance their performance in specialized applications for optimization.

    - My research project delves into the realm of energy storage assets, which play a crucial role in providing electricity to homes and buildings while also storing excess electricity for future use. However, despite their potential, these energy storage assets often remain underutilized due to obstacles surrounding operational control and optimization. To address this challenge, I'm working with the Energy Vault development team to devlop a revolutionary software energy management platform to unlock the untapped capabilities of energy storage assets and optimize their utilization for the benefit of all stakeholders. By integrating diverse energy storage assets, we aim to maximize energy utilization, thus addressing control and monetization issues within large networks of distributed energy resources.

    - My final year reserach project was focused on developing a deep learning model for Breast Cancer diagnosis to improve early detection. This project aimed at improving the radiologist's and cytologist's ability to detect and classify breast cancerous and non-cancerous abnormalities in mammograms. (A mammogram is an x-ray pictures of the breast).
